 Smart Attendance System - Setup and Usage Guide
=================================================

Follow these steps to set up and run the application.

--------------------
### Step 1: Setup
--------------------

1.  **Create a Virtual Environment:**
    Open a terminal in the project's root directory and run the following command to create a virtual environment named 'venv'.

    For Windows:
    python -m venv venv

    For macOS/Linux:
    python3 -m venv venv

2.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
    You must activate the environment before installing packages or running the scripts.

    For Windows (Command Prompt or PowerShell):
    .\venv\Scripts\activate

    For macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate

    After activation, you will see `(venv)` at the beginning of your terminal prompt.

3.  **Install Required Packages:**
    With the virtual environment active, install all the necessary Python libraries using the requirements.txt file.

    pip install -r requirements.txt


--------------------------------------
### Step 2: How to Use the Application
--------------------------------------

You must enroll faces into the database before you can run the attendance system.

**Part A: Enroll a New Person's Face**

This script will guide you to capture 20 high-quality images from different angles.

1.  Make sure your virtual environment is active.
2.  Run the enrollment script:
    python add_faces.py

3.  The terminal will ask you to "Enter the person's name". Type a unique name (using underscores instead of spaces, e.g., 'Soumabha_Majumder') and press Enter.

4.  A webcam window will open. Follow the on-screen "CURRENT GOAL" prompt (e.g., "Look Center", "Look Left").

5.  Hold the requested pose until the rectangle around your face turns green and the script automatically captures a photo.

6.  Repeat this for all guided poses until the process is complete.


**Part B: Run the Smart Attendance System**

This script launches the web application where you can see the live camera feed and track attendance.

1.  Make sure your virtual environment is active.
2.  Run the main application using the Streamlit command:
    streamlit run app.py

3.  This command will automatically open a new tab in your default web browser with the application running.
4.  Click the "Start Attendance System" button to begin recognition.

--------------------
### To Stop the Application
--------------------
-   To stop the `add_faces.py` script, press 'q' while the camera window is active.
-   To stop the Streamlit app, click the "Stop System" button in the browser and close the browser tab. You can then press `Ctrl + C` in your terminal.
-   To deactivate the virtual environment when you are finished, simply type `deactivate` in your terminal and press Enter.
